# Active Learning - Random Sampling / Uncertainty Sampling
Research based on active learning strategies and techniques. Active learning is a field of ML where we have less number of training files than compared to the test samples without the labels. We have an industry expert who can label a few samples for us but at a cost due to time constraints. We use active learning strategies to pick samples to be labelled by the expert so as to improve our overall accuracy of the model.  In this research, we test a few active learning strategies like random sampling and uncertainty sampling and compared results on accuracy. Below we tested on two datasets MMI and Mind Reading Plot and compared results and plotted graphs. Code files have steps on how the accuracy was achieved. Uncertainty (probability-based) sampling gave us better results than random sampling labels.
